    <p>My name is Molly Levine. I am a 26 year old former teacher from Richmond, VA. 
        In my spare time I love to take my puppy to the park, try new restaurants in the 
        area, and watch the same three shows over and over on netflix. 
        My favorite bands include The Beatles, Big Bang, and Bruno Mars. I enjoy trying many different
        things and will give anything a try once.
        I began programming on a whim to find a way out of education, but I have ended up 
        really loving it. I love starting with a blank file and making something new and 
        beautiful.
